Cloud Queues is a library that provides interfaces for working with queue systems. It is an opinionated library unifying the ways of working with queues independently of the underlying system.

It integrates with various queue providers, such as [AWS SQS](systems/sqs.md) or [Azure Service Bus](systems/service-bus.md).
