`fs2-queues` is a library that provides interfaces for working with queue systems. It is an opinionated library unifying the ways of working with queues independently of the underlying system.

It integrates with various queue providers, such as [AWS SQS](systems/sqs.md) or [Azure Service Bus](systems/service-bus.md).

The library is composed of several modules, and is cross-compiled for Scala 2.13 and 3.3.
