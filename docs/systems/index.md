# Providers

`fs2-queues` comes with several queue system implementations. Each of them implements the @:api(QueueClient) abstraction with the various interfaces it gives access to.

Each implementations comes with its own way to get access to a client, depending on the underlying SDK. Please have a look at the provider documentation to see the different ways to instantiate the clients.
